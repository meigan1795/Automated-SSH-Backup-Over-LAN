Title: Design and Development of Automated Incremental Secured Data Backup/Restore Process over Local Area Network using Secure Socket Shell

Description:
This project is to emphasize on the design and development of a batch program to run an automated data backup and restore with the appropriate backup method (differential/incremental backup) between two servers using Secure Socket Shell (SSH) over Local Area Network (LAN) which support compression, deduplication and encryption to archive stronger protection. The backup tools being proposed to be applied in the implementation of this project are Rsync over SSH, GPG key and also cron for the automation of backup process whereas Webmin is to provide the functionality of administration for the user.
